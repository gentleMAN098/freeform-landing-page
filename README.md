This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Details

I decided to create this project using Next.js and TypeScript for better SEO optimization, as it is a landing page.
While developing the code, I considered adding a package to handle certain functionalities, but for a 3-day task,i
thought that was not necessary.
Additionally, I used different styling with MUI in this project to showcase my skills.
Since I didn't have the exact font for the project, I added the Iran Yekan font to ensure the design remained visually
appealing and consistent. Happy coding!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
